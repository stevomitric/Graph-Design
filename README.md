# Graph Design
Built with vanilla Python 3, using *tkinter* as a GUI library, this project implements a visual simulation of most popular graph traversals/algorithms üåê

## Running
[Python 3](https://www.python.org) is all you need to get started. After cloning the repo, starting main file with `python3 main.py` will launch the application. This project was built with modularity in mind, and so it allows for easy addition of new algorithms. Take a look at existing ones and you'll see just how easy it is!

## Usage
GUI Features include:
- Adding new nodes: left click anywhere on canvas
- Connecting nodes: Right click on an existing node and while holding right click, drop the line on another node
- Setting edge weights: hovering mouse over edge cost and typing a new numeric value

## Development
Future updates may include new algorithms, better UI Design, more graph drawing features, random graph generation, import/export options.
